### NHL Scoring Data Analysis

This repository will use NHL game results from MoneyPuck.com to analyze various scoring trends.

I have downloaded game data from [MoneyPuck.com](https://moneypuck.com/data.htm). Halfway down the data page is a link to "download all game level data for all teams for all seasons in one file here". This will give you a all_teams.csv file with the data I am working with.
